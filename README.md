# Test Automation Dashboard
**Prerequisites via docker-compose:**
- Download MySQL database: https://www.mysql.com/downloads/
- Install Docker-compose on your device: ‘https://docs.docker.com/install/’
- Download should be Docker Desktop download

**Prerequisites via manual:**
- Node JS
- Other dependencies can be found at ‘https://angular.io/guide/quickstart’

**Setting up MySQL (needs to be set up manually) :**
- Create a MySQL Database. (The dashboard will set up the tables).
- The user will need read and write access into the particular schema, but may safely be rejected access to parts of the database.
-  Enter MySQL database connection information into python/flaskFiles/config.py
    - The config file requires a database schema name, database schema host, user, and password.
    - Due to how Docker handles routing, if the MySQL server is on the same server as the flask server, then the full hostname of the machine should still be used.

**Configuring Angular:**
- Set the URL of the flask server in test-dashboard/src/app/tests.service.ts
Clients will be attempting to reach the flask server at this URL, so do not set it to “localhost”!

**Running both Angular and Flask Servers:**
- If this is the first time the code has been run, or if there have been any changes, Run:
        ```  
        Docker-compose build; docker-compose up;
        ```
        on root project folder.

- If this gives no errors then skip ‘Running Flask file’ and ‘Running Angular web service’
- If this is not the first time running the dashboard, you can run docker-compose up on its own to save time.

**Running Flask File :**
-  Be sure to be in the directory 'test-dashboard/python/flaskFiles' 
    - Run
          ```
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          ```
    - Run
            ```
            flask run
            ```
- URL to view flask information : http://127.0.0.1:5000/

**Parsing XML File:**
- To tell the Flask server to parse files, upload them on the main page of the flask server. (This is served on port 5000)
- The flask server can accept multiple files at once, and will return a Json object when it has completed.

**Running Angular web service:**
- Make sure you are in the directory <test-dashboard/test-dashboard>
    - Make sure you have angular dependencies downloaded:
        - Node js
        - Other dependencies can be found at ‘https://angular.io/guide/quickstart’
    - Write command
            ```
            ng -o serve
            ```
    - This shall open up the web service for you
